    <h2>Notices from developer</h2>
    <p>This page is incomplete but so far it does its job with basic stuffs of a social networking site (posting, adding friends,..)<br>
       The site runs better on localhost than online. I'm still working on this to figure out why some functions do not work on the internet version.<br>
       Therefore, if you would like to fully experience this site, i recommend you to go with the local one.<br>
        The online version is here: <a href="https://the-book-henry.herokuapp.com/">thebook</a><br>
        The sql file is located in sql foler: "thebook_db.sql"<br>
        Preview image is not working right now on "Change profiel/cover image" page , i am still looking for a way to handle this and database so i just leave it like this for now.
        <br>
        Bonus parts: 
        + Hashing password
        + Deploying online
    </p>

    <h2>-----------------------------------------------------------------</h2>
    <h2>It is not easy to manage a site with this size when i have no experience on this.<br>
        However, i still am trying my best to do it and hopefully, you will enjoy it!
        Please feel free to email me if you have any concern !

        Have a good day. Take care !
